from sympy import symbols, Function, Eq, diff, cos, sin, pi, exp, solve

# Define variables for the energy function
t = symbols('t')  # Time evolution
n = symbols('n')  # Node index (2 to 8, centered on 1)
E = Function('E')(n, t)  # Energy function dependent on node and time

# Define a wave-based energy function centered on 1
omega = pi / 4  # Base frequency of oscillations
decay_factor = exp(-t / 10)  # Exponential decay for Ricci Flow-like smoothing

# Define the field equation for COM energy oscillations
E_equation = Eq(E, decay_factor * (sin(omega * n) + cos(omega * n)))

# Solve for the general form of the energy function
E_solution = solve(E_equation, E)[0]
E_solution

Result
sqrt(2)*exp(-t/10)*sin(pi*(n/4 + 1/4))
